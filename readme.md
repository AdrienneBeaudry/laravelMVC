# GBG Travel Guide: A Laravel MVC Project

## Description

In the spirit of being "a tourist in one's own city", I set out to create a Gothenburg Travel Guide -- for myself, but also for friends, family and acquaintances looking for recommendations. As a first step, because of time restrictions, I focus on 1) a list of restaurants to try; 2) a list of activities to do.

- Laravel (PHP framework)
